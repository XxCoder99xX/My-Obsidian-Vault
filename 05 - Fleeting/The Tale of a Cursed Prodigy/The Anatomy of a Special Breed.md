Many people under the spectrum never see the sun. They lay low, only taking low hanging fruit and never extending out. They live their entire lives unaware of the fact that there is more out there then the comfort zone...

this depressed me. I was disgusted with the idea of being confined. The idea that I was just another damned one was not going to happen.

## I would not let myself sleep that easy
## I was hyperactive. 
## I could not be bound to the jungle.
# I WAS GOING TO SEE THE SUN RISE.
