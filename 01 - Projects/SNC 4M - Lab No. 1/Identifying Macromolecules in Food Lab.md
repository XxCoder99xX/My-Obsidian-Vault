# Identifying Macromolecules in Food Lab
# SNC 4M - Nutritional Science

## Introduction
Food is essential for daily functioning. Food is composed of both macro and micro nutrients - each with different purposes. This lab will use different indicators to detect macronutrients. The four types of macronutrients:
[[Protein]]
[[Carbs]]
[[Fats]]
[[Nucleic Acids(DNA or RNA)]]

The four solutions used:
- [Benedict Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict%27s_reagent) - Detects Simple Carb
- [Iodine Solution](https://microbenotes.com/iodine-test/) - Detects Complex Carbs
- [Biuret Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biuret_test) - Detects Protein
- [Sudan IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan_IV)  - Detects Fats

These indicators are a chemical detector tool. They work by triggering a specific chemical reaction with a macromolecule that shows its presence. Most times it results in a change of color.
