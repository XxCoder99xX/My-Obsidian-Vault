# Identifying Macromolecules in Food Lab
# SNC 4M - Nutritional Science

## Introduction
Food is essential for daily functioning. Food is composed of both macro and micro nutrients - each with different purposes. This lab will use different indicators to detect macronutrients. The four types of macronutrients:
[[Protein]]
[[Carbs]]
[[Fats]]
[[Nucleic Acids(DNA or RNA)]]

The four solutions used:
- [[Benedict Solution]] Simple Carb
- [[Iodine Solution]] Complex Carbs
- [[Biuret Solution]] Protein
- [[Sudan IV]] Fats
These indicators are a chemical detector tool. They work by triggering a specific chemical reaction with a macromolecule that shows its presence. Most times it results in a change of color.
