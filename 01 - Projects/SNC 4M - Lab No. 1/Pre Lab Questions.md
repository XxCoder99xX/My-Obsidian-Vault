# Difference between carbs
## Simple Carbohydrate
Simple carbs like sucrose contain a singular Monosaccharide. An example is glucose, a molecule used in the short term production of ATP.
## Complex Carbohydrate
Complex carbs like starch contain monosaccharides as a [[Monomer]], connected together in long chains. These chains can differ in direction and branching, resulting in different complex carbs. An example is cellulose, which is a carb used in the walling of plants. It is impossible to digest, and is often shorthanded as fiber.
