### Journal
#### TIME - 16:59
Today was fine. I don’t really know what to say here anymore. Most of my days are eventful, but nothing worth putting here. Then again, that alone is being out down. The bruising has reached its height, and now it' will fade away over the coming days and be gone by next week.

One last day. Then that’s one week done.

## Power Journal

### Exhibit 1: Football n’ Stuff
#### Observations:
	Law 1: Never Outshine the Master; you never said anything to offend them, followed there orders, and damn made sure to push yourself.
	Law 28: Enter Actions with Boldness; again, we always have to push ourselves until our shadows sweat.
	Law 48: Assume Formlessness; you never focused on these laws, but by keeping them in your head, you were able to adapt and overcome.
	Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Miserable and the Unfortunate; I am surronded by successful people.
#### Transgressions:
	Law 2: Learn to Use Enemies; I should make better use of motivation generation through envy; oh, there are working out and I'm not? Well now I am. Does not matter if your fingers are splinted, if you can grip the bells, ring em'.
	Law 3: Conceal your Intentions; I could have juked out (concealed my direction) a little better.
