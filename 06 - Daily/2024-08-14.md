### Journal
#### TIME - 12:25

Today was good. All my tasks were complete. I was also able to catch footballs with Johnny, as he wanted to cover me. As much as I thought that he would suck, his juking skills are unmatched. I seriously was getting hit with triple fake-outs and getting more lost than Zoro. However, as I did suspect, if I kept my eyes on him, he was easier to block. He also couldnâ€™t hold onto the ball very well, and that is what eventually cost him it all. While I hit no interceptions, I was able to catch more balls while being calm.
