### Question 3
$$.0759*6.02+.9241*7.02=9.69$$
Therefore the average mass of Lithium is 9.69
### Question 4
$$.7899*23.99+.1000*24.99+.1101*25.98 = 24.309099$$
Therefore the average mass of Magnesium is 24.3
### Question 5
$$68.93*.601+70.92*.399 = 69.72$$
Therefore the average mass of Gallium is 69.72
### Question 6
$$78.92*.5069+80.92*.4931 = 79.90$$
Therefore the average mass of Bromine is 79.90

### Question 3
![[03 - Resources/Excalidraw Diagrams/Lewis_Phosphorus.excalidraw|128px]]
1. There are three unpaired valiance electrons, indicating a charge of -3
2. This is Phosphorus.
3. Phosphorus is element number 15, as shown by the 5 free electrons (2 and 8 (10) are all full; 2+8+5=15).
### Question 4
![[Isotopic Notation]]
### Question 5
A variation of an element who's neutrons difference causes its mass to be either larger or smaller.
### Question 7
The percent that a certain isotope exists in nature.
## Question 8
The reason averages are so common in in the periodic table is that elements without isotopes are extremely rare
## Question 9

## Question 10
$$\displaylines{27.977*.9293+28.976*.0467+29.97*.031 = 28.28}$$
Therefore the average mass of silicon is 28.28.
