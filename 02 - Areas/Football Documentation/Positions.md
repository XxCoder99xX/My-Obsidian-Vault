# Football 101 - Positions

## O-Line
### Linebackers
Linebackers are the backbone of our team, and it’s no wonder why we have such high quality ones; they have to be very versatile and work well in the hardest areas of the game: right in the center. They are responsible for snapping the ball (ok that’s only one of them has that job {center}, but still important) and blocking the d-linemen from breaking through and either:
1. Sacking the QB for an titanic gain
2. Getting to the ballcarrier after QB’s toss
It is therefore why it is very important of them to block the D-Line. Communication is also a *must*, as without it, DB’s are oblivious to if they need to look or not.
#### Signals:
	"BALL BALL BALL!!" - Look at your reciever, and if you see a football flying at him, take it.
	"RUN RUN RUN!" - Drop your reciever instantly and go tackle the ball carrier.
	"Trips ____(_)!" - More recivers on the side called, left or right.
	MOTION MOTION! - Someone is moving before the play. If it is your guy...
	FOLLOW HIM!
### Receivers
Receivers are the people who receive the ball from the QB, be it from pass or toss. There job is to dodge their defender and be alert when they are open.
There are 6 receiver types:
#### Wide Receiver(s)
They line up on the outermost part of the field, and have the job of running a specific route while also getting free of there DB.
#### Tight End
Just a receiver who also can switch it up as a lineman. Not only must he posses the skills of a fast WB, but the strength to block D-Line.
#### Running-back (Ace)
His job is to be handed/short-tossed the ball and run the thing for yards. He’s fast and elusive.
#### Full-back (Fox)
Another Running-back, but he can also usually throw. Used as a decoy and gives our team a lot of options. Has a cannon for an arm, and fast receiver skills.
