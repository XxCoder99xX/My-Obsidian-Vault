Alejandro Zuniga is a character in [[The Blue Zones of Happiness]], serving as a Costa Rica citizen who was struggling. He was poor, lost his soulmate at 20, and suffered from alcohol addiction. Eventually, he was able to get out of the rut and spent his days living in Costa Rica a free man; selling avocados, cheering on the city team, and cracking jokes. Even with 8 dollars in his bank account, he is still happy because of his environment. There are so many people who enjoy his company and so many things to enjoy about the day.

However, he ends up winning a 50 million colonels ($80,000 USD) lottery, but despite that, he stays in Costa Rica, doing the same thing as before. He ends up donating a million here and there to those who need it, the man who gave him the winning ticket, a market beggar, a food bank who'd saved him a few times, and then the rest to his mother. Despite now being broke again, he was still happy.
