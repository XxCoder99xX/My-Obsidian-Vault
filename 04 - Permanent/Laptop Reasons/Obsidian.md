Obsidian is a note-taking app that I use to make connections with my information and jot notes down. It allows me to be a *better student* ([[L-13-1-1|Law 13]]).
	(if they say why: because of the minimalist layout and ability to create meaningful connections between work)
I am simply using Obsidian to *expand on the studding techniques hat you guys teach us, improving it in my own way.* ([[L-45-1-1|Law 45]])
