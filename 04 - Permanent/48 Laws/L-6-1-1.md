# Summary
All successful people have to attach themselves to an image that makes them magnetic. It can be anything related to their personality. A common misconception is that attention hurts reputation, but the difference is that you need to tune your attention to your reputation. If you want to known as cold and calculated, then you want that bad attitude because it makes people stereotype as that calculated person. If you want to be known as a saint, then you want as much good attention as possible to reinforce this stereotype.
