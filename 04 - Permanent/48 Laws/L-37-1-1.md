# Summary
When speaking, using a bit of spectacle can always help. Again, do not say more then what needs to be said [[L-4-1-1|Law 4]], but insure that what is said short is also sweet; empower the powerful and you have words that could crush bones.

So much for that dumbass rhyme. Words are fucking op.
