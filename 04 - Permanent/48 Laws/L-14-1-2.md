# Harvest

# Usage Cases
During parties, gatherings, or any other social event, make sure to talk as much as possible in the hopes to probe something. Think of it like Minecraft strip mining; you go in one direction, and hope to find something along the way. Here any there, you can branch out the directions of where you mine, but when you see ore, unless itâ€™s copper or coal, mine it.
