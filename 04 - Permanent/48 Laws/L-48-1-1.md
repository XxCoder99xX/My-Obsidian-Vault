# Adapt
# Summary
Following the laws that govern life is not possible. No amount of order and system can prepare for the infinite circumstances of life; you will always find situations that can not use your laws. To truly ascend, you must adapt to the situation at hand. Adaptation is what allowed life to exist in the first place, what allows black bears to be such overpowered generalist, and what allows you to finally be free.
