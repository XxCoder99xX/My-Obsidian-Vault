# Harvest

# Reversal
In the same way that you spy, others will too. Insure that what you say is calculated and not valuable. Better yet, flat out lie and just spread misinformation. Don’t lie to the point that it’ll fuck you up, but do it casually and play it off if caught. You have to rig the trade of information in your favor, while also giving enough talk to not seem secretive and secluded. Be around, but do not give anyone anything that can be used against you.
