# Multivitamin Opinion Paper

## Preface

Research and comment on the above statement.  Support your comments and research with proof.


## Opinion
### Thesis
People have been taking multivitamins since the 1940’s in an effort to better their health. However, it’s widely debated whether or not they should be taken on a daily schedule, of if they even provide enough vitamins to be considered useful. In this assignment, I wish to stand on the opinion that people should *not* be taking multivitamins on a daily basis. We will dive into the contents of most multi-vitamins, the impact they make, and the a study analysis to form a concrete statement on why multivitamins are less than necessary.
